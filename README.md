# Iris_classification

The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on specific measurements.

In this notebook, I have loaded the dataset, which includes measurements of different iris flowers, and displayed the data in a structured format. Then various visualizations plots were made to explore the relationships between the flower's features, such as sepal and petal sizes, and categorized them by species. This work helps in understanding how these measurements differ among various types of iris flowers.
